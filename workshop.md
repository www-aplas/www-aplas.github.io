# 2nd Workshop on New and Emerging Results in Programming Languages and Systems

The goal of this two-days workshop is to provide an informal forum for generating interactions and collaborations on programming languages and systems. Strongly encouraged are proposals of new, speculative ideas, evaluations of new techniques in practical settings, and discussions of emerging results and important problems.

We are calling for short talks that give a brief and clear explanation of basic ideas, emerging results, new problems, or new directions. Each talk is meant to be on latest research topics, and can include work that are not yet published or have been recently published.

No formal proceedings will be published. Abstracts and slides will be available online.

The workshop will be held immediately after APLAS 2016 end in Hanoi at noon on 23 Nov 2016.

The entire program will be held at a hotel in Halong Bay, followed by an overnight cruise. We will have a limited number of 20-mins talks, followed by a number of short 10-mins position talks during this workshop.

# Call for Poster
APLAS 2017 will include a poster session during the conference. The poster session aims to give students, researchers and professionals an opportunity to present technical materials to the research community, and to get responses from other researchers in the field.

**Please note that the posters will not be part of the conference proceedings.**

## Scope

Poster contributions are sought in all areas of programming languages and systems, including the following topics:

- Semantics, logics, foundational theory
- Design of languages, type systems and foundational calculi
- Domain-specific languages
- Compilers, interpreters, abstract machines
- Program derivation, synthesis and transformation
- Program analysis, verification, model-checking
- Logic, constraint, probabilistic and quantum programming
- Software security
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Tools and environments for programming and implementation

## Submission

Each presenter should submit an extended abstract of no longer than two 8.5Ã—11 inch pages in PDF via the submission web page, easychair (<https://easychair.org/cfp/aplas2017poster>) by 15 September. The submission should include the title and the complete list of author(s) and affiliation(s). Your abstract should contain a brief description of your problem, the key contributions of your work, how your work compares to prior research, and any results from evaluation. 

You can use ACM template to format your submission, and the ACM template link is here: <https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>.

We will announce the accepted presentations on 22 September. We hope to accommodate every presentation, but may restrict them (based on relevance and interest to the community) due to space constraints. 

## Important Dates
- Submission due: 15 September 2017 (Sunday), 23:59 AoE
- Author Notification: 22 September 2017 (Friday)
- Conference: 27-29 November 2017 (Monday - Wednesday)
