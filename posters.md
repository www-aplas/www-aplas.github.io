# Call for Posters
APLAS 2017 will include a poster session during the conference. The poster session aims to give students, researchers and professionals an opportunity to present technical materials to the research community, and to get responses from other researchers in the field.

## Scope

Poster contributions are sought in all areas of programming languages and systems, including the following topics:

- Semantics, logics, foundational theory
- Design of languages, type systems and foundational calculi
- Domain-specific languages
- Compilers, interpreters, abstract machines
- Program derivation, synthesis and transformation
- Program analysis, verification, model-checking
- Logic, constraint, probabilistic and quantum programming
- Software security
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Tools and environments for programming and implementation

## Submission

Each presenter should submit a 1-2 page abstract in PDF via the submission web page, easychair ( <https://easychair.org/cfp/aplas2017poster>) by 10 September. The abstract should include the title, author(s), affiliation(s) and summary of the work. We will announce the accepted presentations on 22 September. We hope to accommodate every presentation, but may restrict them (based on relevance and interest to the community) due to space constraints.
